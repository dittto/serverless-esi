- parse all esi stuff

- look at https://github.com/silvermine/serverless-plugin-multiple-responses/blob/master/src/index.js for how to change 40x into html
- need to overwrite the api-gateway stuff to alter how it determines 404s and 500s as response is already html

- add flag to only serve up certain urls
